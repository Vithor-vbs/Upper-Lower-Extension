# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/ZVFKbxag1Vs>
#### Description:
## objective
This is a chrome extension that converts your text to upper or lower case. Access information with javaScript and use function lower(text){return text.toLowerCase(); and function upper(text){return text.toUpperCase(); to lower or upper any text.
## html
html one text box and two buttons syntax <input type="text" id="text">
btn1 = Uppercase <button id="btn">Uppercase</button>
btn2 = Lowercase <button id="btn2">Lowercase</button>
## JS
should pick the usuary text (document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded')
should convert case with the click btn ( document.querySelector('#btn').addEventListener('click', function(){let text = document.querySelector('#text').value;)
## programs
this extension is 57.6% of JavaScript and 42.4% HTML
## Idea
I had this idea because I already needed a case converter
it's a simple extension, but I thought it could be userful
## Inspirations
I took inspiratiom on Change Case "The set of advanced methods to change case of text, delivered as convenient extension for browser Google Chrome."
Change Case in Microsoft Word is a command, under Font group, that converts lowercase letters to uppercase and uppercase letters to lowercase.(t's an easy job to change the case of the text you are currently typing into a Word document. You can hold down the shift key and then whatever letter you type will be uppercase. ... Sentence case – in sentence case, the first word of each sentence has a capital letter and all other words are lowercase.)
## funcionality
Just need to whrite something on the text box, and choose the Case function that most suits your objective
The case menu offers two options; Lowercase: It changes the text from uppercase to lowercase. Uppercase: It capitalizes all the all letters of your text.
## About CS50 final
I'm very proud of being part of cs50 this year! This course made me change my mind about programming. My thank's to all cs50's staff, who showed that programming can be fun.
"Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience."
I highly recommend this course! Probably the best computer science introductory of all time.It is a tough ride, absolute life changing course with a lot to offer anyone prepared to tackle the challenge head on. It’s not an easy course, & will take a lot of willpower to get through it. But I do feel I’ve gained a really solid grounding in programming & CS fundamentals as a result of choosing the “hard way”.
CS50 has a good support, you can find peers on facebook, reddit, twitter, cs50 slack, etc (all is available to the CS50X people as well). So after getting some ground knowledge you can do other programming courses.

 This is CS50! :)
